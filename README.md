## ⚠️ Development has moved!

A rewrite of Wav2Bar is happening at: https://github.com/picorims/wav2bar-reborn. Check the milestones and projects to follow the rewrite's progress.

## Important Notes
- **This tool is a side project and is provided as is, without garantee of long term maintenance. If this is fine for you, you can proceed. Enjoy!**
- **This tool is usable at this point, but is still in early development! Your work is subject to bugs, backup your saves!**
- Git LFS used to be used for node_modules and FFMpeg, but is no longer used. Both of these folders have been removed from the repository, but not its history. You do not need to clone them. Git LFS files are no longer included in archive downloads. **If you want a full release source code archive, go to the releases section. This will include node_modules, but not FFmpeg** (which can be downloaded from their official website compiled and packaged).
- I know this is some Frankenstein of a project with an awful architecture, questionnable decisions (why my own UI system and state machine when you have all kinds of frameworks and libs?). It is something I started in high school and that I tried to continuously improve with refreshed novel (which explains the mix of module and non module JS for example). At the same time it is my sandbox for experimentations (custom UI, state machine, etc.). So yeah, it has a lot of awful stuff but I am just having fun there. Which doesn't mean I neglect it either. I have limited time and energy, that I try to avoid spending on endless refactoring (easier said than done). Check the FAQ in the development guidelines file for additional information.

## Hacking
- NodeJS must be installed (It will install npm too).
- Clone the git repository (you can also use GitHub's download button *if you only want to perform tests*). Note that Git LFS is no longer used. Git LFS files are not cloned and packaged anymore.
- Install node modules and dependencies using `npm install`.
- Open the repository folder in a prompt and run `npm start`.
- If everything works, download FFmpeg for your operating system and configure it in the app settings (otherwise export won't work!).

## Compiling
Compilation is done through electron-forge v6's `make` command. No matter the platform, you can compile by running `npm run make` which is an alias to electron-forge make. It will automatically package the app before, but you can also do it using `npm run package`. More info at https://www.electronforge.io/ and https://www.electronforge.io/configuration.

Compilation settings are detailed in package.JSON at the "config" node. You can add additional configurations to export in other formats, but you need to have access to the targetted platform/OS and install required dependencies. The list of available makers is available at https://www.electronforge.io/config/makers.

FFmpeg should be installed independently and not compiled in the application.

### ZIP (Windows, Linux)
Zip maker is available for all platforms, without any dependencies required. It will produce an executable to run the app from anywhere on your machine, without any installation process. Use this if you want a portable installation, that can for example be kept on an external storage device (like a USB stick).

### Windows specific

#### WiX MSI
This maker create a Windows .msi installer. To make a .msi installer, Wix must be installed on the machine (not necessarily Windows), as well as `light` and `candle` installed from the WiX Toolkit. More info at https://www.electronforge.io/config/makers/wix-msi and https://github.com/felixrieseberg/electron-wix-msi.
**The paths for the installer assets are absolute, don't forget to change them in package.json or the make command will fail!**

### Linux specific

#### flatpak

**This option is currently configured but NOT available due to this issue: https://github.com/electron/forge/issues/2561**

This maker creates a flatpak package, which is a sandboxed package that helps deploying applications to many Linux distributions at a time.

As per the Electron Forge documentation (https://www.electronforge.io/config/makers/flatpak):
> You can only build the Flatpak target if you have flatpak, flatpak-builder, and eu-strip (usually part of the elfutils package) installed on your system.

#### deb and rpm
~~There are existing configurations for .deb and .rpm packages **although they have not been tested** as I have no viable Linux development environment at the moment.~~

`deb` and `rpm` packages have been abandoned as their packaging never worked, and Linux support is otherwise guaranteed from other package formats. Instead (if it works), `flatpak` support should be introduced in a future release.



### Mac Specific

#### .pkg packages
Although there is no support for MacOS, the application may run just fine as Electron supports MacOS. If you would like to make a .pkg package for MacOS instead or running from source, you may look at https://www.electronforge.io/config/makers/pkg.
