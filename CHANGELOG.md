## 0.3.4-beta (????-??-??)

### Added

- Wav2Bar now warns if it fails to load a save file due to corrupted internal JSON data.
- Wav2Bar now warns if it is not able to write app data (which can lead to save failure for instance).

### Fixed

- Fixed: Temporary folder is never cleaned up (#69)
    - An automatic clean up of render frames is done at export, and additional info is provided.
- Fixed: False information display for number of points count (#84)
- Fixed: Save files won't load correctly (#73)
    - Wav2Bar now correctly uses the appdata directory instead of picking the disk root directory. To recover old settings on Windows, copy the content of `C:\Wav2Bar` over to `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Wav2Bar` (you likely only want the `user` directory there).
- Some log messages were lost in specific scenarios where the window could not be identified.

## 0.3.3-beta (2023-02-04)

### Fixed
- Fixed: FPS, screen size and JPEG export inputs are completely broken (MSI installation) (#59) 
- Fixed: The open logs folder is broken (#58) 

## 0.3.2-beta (2023-02-02)

### Changed
- The side panel is now resizable.
- The side panel user interface is more responsive, and should be easier to read.

### Fixed
- Fixed: The timer does not export correctly at export (#48).

### Security
- Updated Electron from v16.2.8 to v22.2.0

## 0.3.1-beta (2022-11-01)

### Fixed
- Fixed: The video is cropped when exported if the resolution is greater than 720p (#36).
- Fixed: Trying to export a project with an audio file in mono crashes the export (#34).
- Fixed: Audio file extension containing capital letters may cause errors at export (#38).

### Security
- Updated Electron from v16.0.7 to v16.2.8.
- Updated dependencies.

## 0.3.0-beta (2022-01-21)

### Added
- Particle flow's containers can now be rotated.
- Added logs folder shortcut to settings tab.
- The user interface is now locked behind a loading screen while big operations are performed and the user interface shouldn't be touched.

### Changed
- Changed license from MIT to GPL-3.0-or-later
- Changed how saves and objects are handled internally.
- Improved particle flows performances when using a big amount of particles.
- Optimized bar visualizers when changing their parameters.
- Improved visual updates of particle flows and visualizers while audio is paused or stopped.
- Changing an object's name is now done using a dedicated field in the rack (less clicks!).
- Changed rules for timers positioning. (The converter should reajust timers when opening a project from an older version.)
- Changed some default values (it only affects newly created objects and new object parameters).
- The default color is now randomized.
- Irrelevant options (i.e that have no effect) in some objects are no longer available (timers, visualizers). In consequence they are no longer stored as well with these objects (as they are useless).
- Made top user interface for audio and zoom control more compact.
- Split audio control block in half in the top user interface for better display in a smaller window.
- Improved help on object creation.
- Improved responsiveness on window resize.

### Removed
- Removed background visual object that duplicates image/shape visual object. Existing background visual objects in older saves will be converted to image visual objects.

### Fixed
- Video export via CLI works again.
- Particle flow's flow type parameter provides help again.
- When opening a new save, existing user interface from old visual objects are now effectively removed.
- Interacting with control panel's top tabs no longer moves the rest of the user interface.
- The top of the screen was hard to see, and hidden no matter what behind the top user interface (in some zoom and window size scenarios). There is now a minimum of padding above the screen.
- The window no longer flashes to white when being first opened.
- Changing the color of a waves visualizer while audio is paused now updates the color visually. Same for particle flows.
- About section no longer have the text centered.

### Security
- Updated Electron from v12 to v16.
- Updated dependencies in general

    - Use `--help` flag to receive help.

## 0.2.0-beta (2021-07-21)

### Added
- Added SVG filters support to all objects.
- Added shortcuts for easy positioning of objects based on the screen.
- Added shortcuts for easy sizing of objects to screen size.
- Added a color picker.
- Added experimental JPEG export (quality 100) instead of PNG, the quality should not be impacted and the export faster.
